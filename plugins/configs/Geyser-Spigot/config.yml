# --------------------------------

# Network settings for the Bedrock listener
bedrock:
  # The IP address that Geyser will bind on to listen for incoming Bedrock connections.
  # Generally, you should only change this if you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server.
  address: 0.0.0.0

  # The port that will Geyser will listen on for incoming Bedrock connections.
  # Since Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses UDP, this port must allow UDP traffic.
  port: 19132

  # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock.
  # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server.
  clone-remote-port: false

# Network settings for the Java server connection
java:
  # What type of authentication Bedrock players will be checked against when logging into the Java server.
  # Can be "floodgate" (see https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/), "online", or "offline".
  auth-type: online

# MOTD settings
motd:
  # The MOTD that will be broadcasted to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is irrelevant if "passthrough-motd" is set to true.
  # If either of these are empty, the respective string will default to "Geyser"
  primary-motd: "Rivalez Minecraft, es un servidor familiar de Minecraft."
  secondary-motd: "Si has sido invitado por favor, disfruta tu estancia y diviértete!"

  # Whether Geyser should relay the MOTD from the Java server to Bedrock players.
  passthrough-motd: true

  # Maximum amount of players that can connect.
  # This is only visual, and is only applied if passthrough-motd is disabled.
  max-players: 6

  # Whether to relay the player count and max players from the Java server to Bedrock players.
  passthrough-player-counts: true

  # Whether to use server API methods to determine the Java server's MOTD and ping passthrough.
  # There is no need to disable this unless your MOTD or player count does not appear properly.
  integrated-ping-passthrough: true

  # How often to ping the Java server to refresh MOTD and player count, in seconds.
  # Only relevant if integrated-ping-passthrough is disabled.
  ping-passthrough-interval: 3

# Gameplay options that affect Bedrock players
gameplay:
  # The server name that will be sent to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is visible in both the pause menu and the settings menu.
  server-name: Rivalez

  # Allow a fake cooldown indicator to be sent. Bedrock players otherwise do not see a cooldown as they still use 1.8 combat.
  # Please note: if the cooldown is enabled, some users may see a black box during the cooldown sequence, like below:
  # https://geysermc.org/img/external/cooldown_indicator.png
  # This can be disabled by going into Bedrock settings under the accessibility tab and setting "Text Background Opacity" to 0
  # This setting can be set to "title", "actionbar" or "disabled"

  # Bedrock clients can freeze when opening up the command prompt for the first time if given a lot of commands.
  # Disabling this will prevent command suggestions from being sent and solve freezing for Bedrock clients.

  show-coordinates: true

  # Whether Bedrock players are blocked from performing their scaffolding-style bridging.
  disable-bedrock-scaffolding: false

  # Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether.
  # This config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID to the End ID.
  # The main downside to this is that the entire Nether will have the same red fog rather than having different fog for each biome.
  nether-roof-workaround: false

  # Whether to show Bedrock Edition emotes to other Bedrock Edition players.
  emotes-enabled: true

  # Which item to use to mark unavailable slots in a Bedrock player inventory. Examples of this are the 2x2 crafting grid while in creative,
  # or custom inventory menus with sizes different from the usual 3x9. A barrier block is the default item.
  # This config option can be set to any Bedrock item identifier. If you want to set this to a custom item, make sure that you specify the item in the following format: "geyser_custom:<mapping-name>"
  unusable-space-block: minecraft:barrier

  # Whether to add any items and blocks which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition.
  # This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the "transfer packet" style of server switching.
  # If this is disabled, furnace minecart items will be mapped to hopper minecart items.
  # Geyser's block, item, and skull mappings systems will also be disabled.
  # This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.
  enable-custom-content: true

  # Force clients to load all resource packs if there are any.
  # If set to false, it allows the user to connect to the server even if they don't
  # want to download the resource packs.

  # Whether to automatically serve a resource pack that is required for some Geyser features to all connecting Bedrock players.
  # If enabled, force-resource-packs will be enabled.
  enable-integrated-pack: true

  # Whether to forward player ping to the server. While enabling this will allow Bedrock players to have more accurate
  # ping, it may also cause players to time out more easily.

  # Allows Xbox achievements to be unlocked.
  # If a player types in an unknown command, they will receive a message that states cheats are disabled.
  # Otherwise, commands work as expected.
  xbox-achievements-enabled: false

  # The maximum number of custom skulls to be displayed per player. Increasing this may decrease performance on weaker devices.

# For online mode authentication type only.
# Stores a list of Bedrock player usernames that should have their Java Edition account saved after login.
# This saves a token that can be reused to authenticate the player later. This does not save emails or passwords,
# but you should still be cautious when adding to this list and giving others access to this Geyser instance's files.
# Removing a name from this list will delete its cached login information on the next Geyser startup.
# The file that tokens will be saved in is in the same folder as this config, named "saved-refresh-tokens.json".

pending-authentication-timeout: 120

# Whether to alert the console and operators that a new Geyser version is available that supports a Bedrock version

# auto-update.
notify-on-new-bedrock-update: true

# Advanced configuration options. These usually do not need modifications.
advanced:
  # Specify how many days player skin images will be cached to disk to save downloading them from the internet.

  cache-images: 0

  # Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle
  # a lot of scoreboard packets per second, this can cause serious lag.
  # This option allows you to specify after how many Scoreboard packets per seconds
  # the Scoreboard updates will be limited to four updates per second.

  # Whether Geyser should send team names in command suggestions.
  # Disable this if you have a lot of teams used that you don't need as suggestions.

  # Advanced networking options for the Geyser to Java server connection

    # 2) You run Velocity or BungeeCord with the option enabled in the proxy's main config.
    # IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON'T TOUCH IT!
    use-haproxy-protocol: false

    # Whether to connect directly into the Java server without creating a TCP connection.
    # This should only be disabled if a plugin that interfaces with packets or the network does not work correctly with Geyser.
    # If enabled, the remote address and port sections are ignored.
    # If disabled, expect performance decrease and latency increase.

    # Whether Geyser should attempt to disable packet compression (from the Java Server to Geyser) for Bedrock players.
    # This should be a benefit as there is no need to compress data when Java packets aren't being handled over the network.

    disable-compression: true

  # Advanced networking options for Geyser's Bedrock listener
  bedrock:
    # The port to broadcast to Bedrock clients with the MOTD that they should use to connect to the server.

    compression-level: 6

    # Whether to expect HAPROXY protocol for connecting Bedrock clients.

    # Disabling Bedrock authentication for other use-cases is NOT SUPPORTED, as it allows anyone to spoof usernames, and is therefore a security risk.
