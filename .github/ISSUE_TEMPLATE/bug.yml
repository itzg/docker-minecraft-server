        Thanks for taking the time to report a bug.
        
        Please double check some things first:
        1. Do you just have a question about something? If so, asking in the [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/discussions/categories/q-a) or asking on [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/DXfKpjB) would be best.
        2. Is this bug happening after the `[init]` prefixed logs and after the log that says "Starting the Minecraft server"? If so, please report the bug with Mojang or the respective server provider.
        3. Are you seeing a performance problem? If so, that is typically outside the scope of the image setup mechanims. Ask a question as above or contact the respective server provider.

        Please provide container logs from the start of the container, which will be the ones prefixed with `[init]`. It is even better if you can set the variable `DEBUG` to "true" and provide those debug container logs.
